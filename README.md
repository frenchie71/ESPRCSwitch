# ESPRCSwitch
RC Switch with Web Interface.

Tested with Arduino 1.6.8 (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) from the Arduino website and Arduino ESP8266 core 2.3.0 (https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

You need also the rc-switch library (https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch), the version I used is in the zip file.
